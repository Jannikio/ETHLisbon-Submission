<h1>Degenmove</h1>

<h2>Project Description</h2>

<div>
Reproduce on-chain transactions of smart money wallets without any code. Follow a successful meme coin trader, NFT whale, DeFi farmer, trading fundâ€™s wallets, etc. Degenmove focuses on execution, not on analytics. 
For the 36-hour timeframe of the hackathon, we have narrowed the big idea to on-chain coins copytrading, focusing on efficient on-chain copytrading execution.
MVP user story: As a retail trader, I want to follow DEX trades of a successful trader, so my assets get automatically traded in an efficient way.
Lots of assumptions in the MVP.
